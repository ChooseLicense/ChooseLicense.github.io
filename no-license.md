选择退出开源软件协议并不意味着你加入了版权保护法。

你需要和你的律师检查你的项目是否受受法律保护，不过一般来说，没有许可证默认使用版权保护法，这意味着你保留所有权力，不允许任何人复制，分发或创建衍生作品。

如果你要退出开源软件协议你不需要做任何事情，但仍推荐你放置一个简单的版权声明。

Disallowing use of your code might not be what you intend by "no license." An [open-source license](/) allows reuse of your code while retaining copyright. If your goal is to completely opt-out of copyright restrictions, try a [public domain dedication](/licenses/#unlicense).

Even in the absence of a license file, you may grant some rights in cases where you publish your source code to a site that requires accepting terms of service. For example, if you publish your source code in a public repository on GitHub, you have accepted the [Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service), by which you allow others to view and fork your repository; but this alone does not allow for the kinds of collaboration that people usually seek on a public code host, such as experimentation, modification, and sharing as fostered by an open source license.

## For users

If you find software that doesn't have a license, that generally means you have no permission from the creators of the software to use, modify, or share the software. Although a code host such as GitHub may allow you to download or fork the code, this does not imply that you are permitted to use, modify, or share the software for any purpose.

Your options:

**Ask the maintainers nicely to add a license.** Unless the software includes strong indications to the contrary, lack of a license is probably an oversight. If the software is hosted on a site like GitHub, open an issue requesting a license and include a link to this site, or if you're bold and it's fairly obvious what license is most appropriate, open a pull request to add a license.

**Don't use the software.** Find or create an alternative that is under an open source license.

**Negotiate a private license.** Bring your lawyer.
